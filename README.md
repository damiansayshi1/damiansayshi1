<ul>
  <li><b>Static Memory Management –</b> Uses fixed-size arrays in <code>.bss</code> to store up to 500 badgers and 100 staff records without dynamic allocation.</li>
  <li><b>Core Operations –</b> Supports adding, deleting, searching, and displaying records with custom validation and calculations.</li>
  <li><b>Low-Level Efficiency –</b> Manual pointer arithmetic, string handling, and register-based loops optimize performance in x86-64 assembly.</li>

</h2>

<ul>
  <li><b>Developed a secure web application from scratch in C++ using the CGICC library and a MariaDB backend, focusing on robust security practices.</li>
  <li><b>Implemented critical defense mechanisms against common threats, including SHA-256 password hashing, secure session management, and sanitization to prevent XSS and SQL injection attacks.</li>
  <li><b>Conducted a full security audit on a legacy C program, identifying and patching major vulnerabilities like buffer overflows and hardcoded credentials.</li>

</h2>

<ul>
  <li><b>Designed and simulated a secure, multi-floor enterprise network topology in Cisco Packet Tracer to support 240+ users across 7 distinct VLANs.</li>
  <li><b>Implemented a structured Fixed-Length Subnet Masking (FLSM) scheme for scalability and configured inter-VLAN routing on Layer 3 switches.</li>
  <li><b>Hardened the network by deploying an ASA firewall, enforcing switch port security, shutting down unused ports, and securing the wireless network with WPA2-AES.</li>
